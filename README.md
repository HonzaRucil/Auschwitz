# Auschwitz

3D virtual tour of the former Nazi concentration camp for educational purposes

First of all I want to say that I am aware that this is a very sensitive topic.  
This project is NOT a "game" or "fun", nor it is meant to show any disrespect. It should not offend anybody.

Many people today can view the depicted horrors as insulting. They don´t like to see, what others had to experience.
I personally felt fear when making these scenes. It scares me to imagine to be in that place during the WW2. 
And that exactly is the message of this project. Try to imagine yourself in the place of a victim.

I tried to depict Auschwitz as realistic as possible. This includes the buildings, guards, inmates, sufferring, and death. Again, I don´t want to offend anybody.

This has purely documentation character.

PS: I am partly Jew myself
